# Better IMS

This app can be used in an setting that inventory is managed. I created it because I wanted to make my job at Starbucks easier by making the process of ordering and receiving products more efficient. This API stores inventory, adds to that inventory when an order is received, and deducts inventory according to daily usage. The best part, this all happens in one app.
